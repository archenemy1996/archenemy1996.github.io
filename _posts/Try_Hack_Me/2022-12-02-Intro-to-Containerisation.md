It's a write-up about the room : [Try Hack Me - Room : Intro to Containerisation](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtocontainerisation)

# Task 1 : Introduction

This room is the first of a series explaining the popular technology of containerisation. It

**Learning Outcomes:**

By completeing this room , we will know:

  - What is containerisation
  - where and why containersation is used
  - A fundamental understanding of populer containersation technology called docker
  - What makes docker so popular 
  - How containerisation works

Mark the question to move on to the task 2

# Task 2 : What is Containerisation 

In computing terms, containerisation is the process of packaging an application and the necessary resources (such as libraries and packages) required into one package named container. The process of packaging application together makes application considerably portable and hassle-free to run.

Modern applications are often complex and usually depend on frameworks and libraries being installed on a device before the appication can run. These dependencies can:

  - Be difficult to install depending on the environment the application is running(some operating systems might not support them!)

  - Create difficulty for developers to diagnose and replicate faults, as it could be a problem with the application's environment - not the application itself!
  
  - Can often conflict with each other. For example, having multiple versions of Python to run different applications is a headache for the user, and an application may work with one version of Python and not another.

Containerisation platforms remove this headache by packaging the dependencies together and “isolating” (note: this is not to be confused with "security isolation" in this context) the application’s environment.
